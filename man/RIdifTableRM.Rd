\title{DIF analysis dichotomous - requires having set up dif.variables}
\usage{
RIdifTableRM(dfin, dif.var, cutoff = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{dfin}{Dataframe with item data only}

\item{dif.var}{DIF variable}

\item{cutoff}{Cutoff in item location logit difference for table highlighting}
}
\description{
Makes use of the psychotree package, which also allows for interactions
between DIF variables, which is not implemented in this function (yet).
}
\details{
DIF variables need to be vectors with the same length as the number of rows
in the dataset.

sample usage: RIdifTable(df, dif.age)
}
